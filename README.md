install the gnome3 argos extention:

then place the script in the .config/argos/   
and "chmod +x" it.

you can edit the script to show the price for more than one pair. default is USD BTC and MXN.
the plugin uses the devault icon from the devault core wallet. if you dont have it installed    
then you can edit the icon setting in the plugin to NO
